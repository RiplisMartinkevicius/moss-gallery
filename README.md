## Moss gallery

This is a project that showcases moss pictures using React with TypeScript. It was built using Vite, for faster development.

It's still a WIP and I'm planning to add these functionalities:
1. Search bar functionality.
2. Create routes for the shown links.
3. Implement the main gallery functionality, to show the images.
4. Create home/moss info/contact pages.
5. Clean up styling.


### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. To start the development server, run the following command: `npm run dev` and view it using your browser on the specified port in the console.
